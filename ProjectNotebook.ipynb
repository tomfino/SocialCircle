    "This code works with a Social Circle object, which contains a list of friends for a peron's social circle. It allows them to keep track of who is in their social circle, as well as each person's respective \"friend rating\" (1-5), which evaluates a friend's value/closeness to a person. It also quantifies popularity using a \"friend score\", which takes the amount of friends a person has along with their friend scores to create a total sum of friend ratings.\n",

    "The project contains methods which can add friends to the social circle, as well as ghost friends who fall below a friend rating of 1. Users can initiate hangouts, which adjust friend ratings depending on whether the hangout was fun or not. If a user is bored, they can pick a random friend to hang out with.\n",

    "I first tried learning Python entering my freshman year of high school, although I didn't get very far before I gave up on it. It wasn't until I took AP Computer Science A in senior year that I became much more comfortable with coding; the class was really fun and I wanted to try coding in a more relevant language.\n",
    "\n",
    "With my project, I wanted to include methods which interacted with each other (the bored() and hangout() methods, the hangout() and ghost_friend() methods) as I felt it would add more depth than just calling methods to print strings. I could have stopped with creating the SocialCircle class, but I went a step further and added a function (compare_popularity()) which takes two SocialCircle objects and has them interact with each other, which I wasn't fully comfortable doing at first. What particularly challenged me was that most methods updated the self.friend_score instance variable while also printing something, so I spent a lot of time ensuring the get_friend_score() method functioned properly and any changes to self.friends or friend ratings were accurately reflected in that. Overall, I feel I took a fairly basic concept and fleshed it out to a more advanced level."
